# Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrauselevy/">Sophia Krause-Levy</a> (Instructor)

This course focuses on two main topics: The basics of organizing data for
efficient computation, and the design of programs that use collections,
classes, and interfaces.

Each week, we will explore topics in these areas interactively during lectures.
You will read beyond what we explore in lecture, complete programming
assignments to hone your coding and program design skills, and take exams that
test your understanding of what you've learned. After, you'll be better at
designing and understanding programs and the structure of data they work
over.

Basics: <a href="#b:lec">Lecture</a>, <a href="#b:disc">Discussion</a>,
<a href="#programming">Programming Assignments</a>, and <a
href="#b:exams">Exams</a>. Check the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> for
class topics, links to resources, and assignment due dates. The <a
href="#staff">course instructional team</a> is here to help you learn: <a
href="#help">ask for help and advice</a>!

This page also describes how you will be <a href="#grading">graded</a>, and
there are <a href="#policies">other course policies</a> you should be
familiar with as well.

## Schedule
<a id="schedule"></a>

This schedule has links to the programming and review activities you will
complete for the course. You are responsible for checking this schedule and
completing work by the deadlines given, which are always at 11pm local San
Diego time on the listed date.

### <a id="b:disc" href="#b:disc">Discussion</a>

Discussions will reinforce concepts from class and introduce concepts that
are especially helpful for completing programming assignments. Students from
either section can attend either discussion. In general, the Tuesday section
will focus more on reinforcing concepts, and Fridays will focus more on
introducing programming assignments.

## <a id="staff" href="#staff">Staff</a>

There are many instructional staff to help with your learning. You can find
their names and pictures on <a
href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/summer2022/cse12/staff" target="_blank">Piazza
Staff page</a>. Our “home base” is in B260 in the CSE building (basement), but
you can work in any lab. You should use <a href="https://autograder.ucsd.edu"
target="_blank">Autograder</a> to ask for help in open lab hours. In addition,
Professor Sophia and the two TAs each hold individual weekly office hours that
you can attend. You can use either of these resources whether you're looking
for help on an assignment or material covered in class. The schedule for both
office hours and lab hours are below. For office hours, the room number is
noted on the event itself.

and <a href="https://piazza.com/class/l3oedrn1kia73m" target="_blank">view the discussion forum here</a>.
Important announcements from the course team will be pinned at the top of your feed.
When you set up your account, you can select the frequency for email notifications of messages and discussions
on Piazza.  Piazza is one way you can <a href="#pa:piazzahelp">ask for and get help</a> in this course.

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/11/" target="_blank">The
documentation for the Java language</a>, while not required reading, will be
linked to from some assignments and is always a useful reference while
programming. We will be using Java version **11** for the programming
assignments in this course, which is available at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html">Oracle's web site</a>.

You'll be submitting your classwork and seeing grading feedback through a
tool called <a href="http://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.

You'll be receiving starter code through a service called <a
href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>. You aren't required to
have an account to complete coursework, but it can be useful for you to make
one.

### <a id="b:engage" href="#b:engage">Engagement</a>

We highly recommend actively participating in class, attending discussion,
and completing the weekly review quizzes. Regularly engaging with the class
in these ways counts towards the Engagement component of your overall score.

This score is calculated on a weekly basis (starting in Week 1). The maximum
number of points you can earn in one week is 6. The lowest weekly
participation score will be dropped when calculating your overall engagement
average.

Earn engagement points by:
* __In class participation via iClickers__  In Weeks 1 through 5 (starting with the second lecture of the quarter), you will earn credit for attending and participating in lecture (2 points each) and discussion section (1 point each, up to a maximum
of 8 points per week). Clicker questions will be graded for participation only and not for correctness of the response. Full credit for clicker points for a given day will be
awarded for clicking in at least 80% of the time that day. Forgetting your clicker counts as missing a class, so please remember to bring it! We have you respond to problems in lecture because there’s quite a bit of evidence that sitting and listening passively [probably isn’t the best way to teach or learn science](https://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963). <a id="p:clicker-ai"></a>
 _Do not attempt to falsify iClicker or discussion participation or review quiz submissions; this would be considered a violation of academic integrity._

* __Weekly (P)review quiz__ Online quizzes review the week's material and preview some upcoming examples each week. You can submit your answers to each quiz as many times as you like. The latest submission before 11pm on Tuesday will count towards your engagement score. Each weekly review quiz will be worth 6 points.  Review quizzes will stay available even after the
deadline; in the past, students have found working through them to be helpful when studying for exams.
<a id="p:quiz-ai"></a>
_The review quiz must be completed independently and individually. You may refer to your class notes and resources linked from this website, but not to other references. You may not share information about the review quiz with others, take the review quiz in someone
else's name, or ask anyone for prior knowledge about the review quiz._


We encourage you to find your preferred method for staying engaged with the course.  There are lots of ways to earn full credit for a week's engagement.  For example: (1) attending all lectures (for the section in which you're enrolled); or (2) attending two lectures and two discussion sections; or (3) answering all questions on the review quiz correctly; or (4)
attending two lectures and getting two answers correct on the review  quiz; etc.

## <a id="b:exams" href="#b:exams">Exams</a>


There will be four tests during the quarter and a final exam. The tests will be held during lecture on Wednesdays weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5. The final exam will be held on Friday July 29th @11:30am.

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations). You may not speak to any other student in the exam room while the exam is in progress (including after you hand in your own exam).  You may not share any information about the exam with any student who has not yet taken it (including students in future quarters of CSE12).

* All 50% of your exam points come from your final exam score.

* The final exam will be split into four sections, roughly corresponding to the material covered by each test, and each worth 25% of your exam score

* The score you get on each test contributes to your final exam score in the relevant category, up to a maximum of 10% of the 25% for that section. You can’t score more than 25% on each section of the final exam with this additional contribution. 

* If you get a lower score on the final exam than the average of your test scores minus 20%, you instead earn that score on the final.

This means that each test contributes to your final exam score, but if you miss or do poorly on a test you can always make up the credit by doing well on the corresponding section of the final exam.


**Example:** A student scores 50%, 60%, 0%, and 80% on the four tests. On the final exam, they score 10/25, 20/25, 20/25, 15/25 on each of the four sections. Their final exam score would be (10 + 5) + (20 + 6) + (20 + 0) + (15 + 8) for a total of 83/100 on the exam.

**Example:** A student scores 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% on the tests, and then skips the final. Their final exam grade will be 55%.

**Example:** A student scores 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% on the tests, and then gets only 5/25 of the credit in each portion of the final exam. Their final exam grade will be 80%.

**Make-up Exams:** There are no make-up exams given. If you miss one of the tests, your score for that test is a 0 and you don’t earn credit towards that part of the final exam ahead of time. Note that this doesn’t necessarily impact your final grade, since you can still earn all of the credit on the final exam itself. Similarly, if you miss or skip the final, the average-replacement policy applies.

## <a id="programming" href="#programming">Programming</a>

Most weeks, you will be working on a programming assignment for this class.
There are several specific policies in place regarding programming
assignments, and you should pay careful attention to them.

### <a id="p:open-closed" href="#p:open-closed">Collaboration</a>

**This is not the same collaboration policy you have seen in your other
programming courses. Read it carefully.**

In your professional programming life, some of your work will be highly
collaborative with lots of expert advice available from senior developers and
from sites like StackOverflow. This is a common case in companies, in
academia, and on open-source projects. It's a great way to get exposed to new
techniques, share knowledge, and generally enjoy teamwork. In contrast, some
of your work will involve figuring out programming problems on your own,
where you are the first person to encounter an issue, or the first person to
try using a new library in the context of your application. You should get
experience in both types of situations; we might call the former kind of
problem **open to collaboration** and the latter **closed to collaboration**.

In terms of courses, this split also makes sense. Programming assignments
serve (at least) two roles. First and foremost, they are a mechanism for you
to learn! By directly applying the techniques and skills we discuss in class,
you get practice and become a better programmer. Second, they are an
assessment mechanism – as instructional staff we use them to evaluate your
understanding of concepts as demonstrated by your programs. Open
collaboration can reduce frustration while learning and give you chances to
enjoy collaboration and lots of help, but may not let us accurately evaluate
your understanding. Closed assignments are an opportunity for
you to demonstrate what you know by way of programming.

There are two types of assignments in this course, **open** and **closed**:

- **Open** assignments, for which you can talk to anyone else
  in the course, post snippets of code on Piazza, get lots of help from TAs,
  and generally come up with solutions collaboratively. TAs will be happy to
  look at your code and suggest approaches and fixes.
  
  There are a few restrictions:
  - Any code that you didn't write must be cited in the README file that goes
    along with your submission

    **Example:** On an open assignment, you and another
    student chat online about the solution, you figure out a particular
    helper method together. Your README should say “The FOO function was
    developed in collaboration with Firstname Lastname”

    **Example:** On an open assignment, a student posts the
    recursive method calls they used to solve a problem you were
    struggling with. Your README should say “I used the code from
    https://piazza.com/class/id-of-post”.

  - Anyone you work with in-person must be noted in your README

    **Example:** You and another student sit next to each other in the lab,
    and point out mistakes and errors to one another as you work through
    the assignment. As a result, your solutions are substantially similar.
    Your README should say “I collaborated with Firstname Lastname to
    develop my solution.”
  - You cannot share an entire repository of code or paste an entire solution
    into Piazza. Keep snippets to reasonable, descriptive chunks of code; think
    a dozen lines or so to get the point across.
  - You still _cannot_ use code that you find online (no copying code
    from StackOverflow or blogs online), or get assistance or code from
    students outside of this offering of the class. All the code that is
    handed in should be developed by you or someone in the class.
  - You are responsible for _understanding_ all the code you have written.
    All of the programming problems on the PAs may show up on exams, where
    you will need to have a thorough understanding of the PA to answer the
    questions.


  This doesn't mean the staff will be handing out answers. We'll mostly
  respond with leading questions and advice, and you shouldn't expect a
  direct answer to questions like “am I done?” or “is my code right?”

  There is no guarantee the assistance you get from your classmates is
  correct. It is your responsibility to use your judgment to avoid using an
  idea on Piazza that is wrong, or doesn't work with your solution; we won't
  necessarily tell you one way or another while the assignment is out.

  If we see that you used code from other students and didn't cite it in the
  README, the penalty will range from a point deduction to an academic
  integrity violation, depending on the severity. Always cite your work!

- **Closed** assignments, where you cannot collaborate with others.
  You can ask clarification questions and report potential issues as private
  posts on Piazza or to staff members. However, staff will not look at your
  code or comment on it. Lab/office hours these weeks are for conceptual
  questions or for questions about past assignments only, no code assistance.
  Treat these assignments like take-home exams.

  On closed assignments:
    - You cannot look at or use anyone else's code in any way.
    - You cannot discuss the assignment, even in general terms, with anyone
      other than the course staff.
    - You should expect that staff members will politely say “The course
      policy says I can't help with that” if you ask a question about your
      algorithm or code.
    - You cannot post publicly about the assignment on Piazza or elsewhere
      online.
    - All of the examples in the open section above would be
      academic integrity violations.

Programming assignments will explicitly list whether they are open or closed
collaboration.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### <a id="p:grading" href="#p:grading">Grading Programming Work</a>

Each programming assignment will have a portion that is automatically graded,
and a portion that is manually graded by the course staff.

After each assignment's deadline, we will open a resubmission for that
assignment for two weeks (this time period may be shorter for assignments
near the end of the quarter). You can resubmit to improve the automated part
of your grade. You can gain up to _half_ the points you lost in the initial
submission through resubmission; we'll divide the difference of the initial
and resubmission by 2 and add it to the original. There's no penalty for
(accidentally or intentionally) resubmitting work that is marked lower. There
is no way to resubmit and recover points for the manually graded part of
assignments, which must be submitted before the deadline.

This policy also serves as the late policy for programming assignments; if
you don't submit an assignment, the initial grade is 0, and you can get half
of the automated points by submitting after the deadline. There is no other
late policy for programming work.

_Example_: On a PA, you submit and get 40/80 for the automated score, and
10/20 for the manual score. After the deadline, you find many of your
mistakes and resubmit, and get a new automated grade of 70/80. Your new score
would be

(70 - 40) / 2 + 40 = 55

for the automated part, and the manually-graded part would remain 10, for
total of 65 (rather than the original 50) points on the assignment.

In addition, closed-collaboration assignments are treated as **open** once
their deadline passes. You can talk to other students about them, get coding
help from staff on them, and so on. Please make use of these resources to
understand where your solution was incorrect or incomplete, and resubmit!

## <a id="help" href="#help">Getting Help</a>

<h3>Working and getting help in the lab</h3>

You have <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php" target="_blank">computer accounts</a> for the labs in the CSE building.  Even if you choose to work on your programming assignments on
your own computer, you can work in these labs. The type of programming assignment you are working on will determine whether you can <a href="#pa:pa-collab">collaborate with other students</a> in the lab.

During <a href="#staff">open lab hours</a>, tutors, TAs, and the
instructors will be available to help. We will work with you to get you un-stuck when you're not sure what to do next on an
assignment. We will be using the <a href="https://autograder.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Autograder</a> system to manage to queue of
requests for help in lab.  To get in the queue, log into Autograder with your @ucsd.edu email and submit your question as a ticket:

- Give a meaningful question or problem statement in your ticket.
- Be prepared! When the tutor shows up, you should be ready to reproduce the issue you're having, have a test case that doesn't produce the right output, show them a drawing of the situation you're confused about, etc.

Expect to have about 5 minutes with a tutor (or TA or instructor): you probably won't have the solution at the end of the conversation, but you should feel un-stuck and ready to try new approaches.

<a id="pa:piazzahelp"></a>
<h4>Asking & Answering questions on Piazza</h4>

Piazza is an online discussion board where we can make announcements and students can ask questions. Both we (the course staff) and your classmates can answer your questions. There are a few kinds of questions you should ask on Piazza:

- Private questions about closed programming assignments for clarification
- Private questions about your grade / account
- Public questions about open programming assignments
- Public questions about the content of lecture, discussion, lab, and any readings

For each assignment, you will find a Frequently Asked Questions post, where we will answer all common questions we receive in office hours and via (private) Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post, we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new important questions and answers come in.

When answering questions, be polite, be clear, and assume the best intentions of the person asking. If it turns out you make a mistake or were wrong, admit it with a smile (emoji are great for this 😊), and make sure the correct information is clear. Above all, keep in mind that the course is a community whose goal is to foster a positive learning environment for everyone. For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official! They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by accident. “My classmate said so on Piazza” is not a legitimate justification in most arguments, though they may
indeed lead you in helpful directions.



## <a id="grading" href="#grading">Grading</a>

Your grade will be computed from:

<ul>
  <li>40% programming assignments</li>
  <li>50% exams</li>
  <li>10% engagement</li>
</ul>


TODO: closed or open or mix per assignment
There are **3 closed** and **5 open** PAs. We will use an _ordered
weighting_ to assign the 40 PA points.

For the 3 closed PAs, we will order them from highest to lowest in terms of
percentage scored on the PA itself, and then assign the proportions of the
following points to each:

- 8% highest scoring
- 7% middle
- 5% lowest

For the 5 open PAs, we will order them from highest to lowest in terms of percentage scored on the PA itself, and then assign the proportions of the following points to each:

- 8% highest scoring
- 7% 2nd highest scoring
- 6% 
- 5%
- 4% lowest scoring

**Example**: You score:

- PA1:  90%
- PA2:  50%
- PA3:  70%
- PA4:  80%
- PA5: 100%
- PA6:  92%
- PA7:  90%
- PA8: 100%

The closed PAs would be ordered 100% (PA5), 90% (PA7), 50% (PA2).

The points would be 1 * 8 + 0.9 * 7 + 0.5 * 5 = 16.8 points

The open PAs would be ordered 100% (PA8), 92% (PA6), 90% (PA1), 80% (PA4),
70% (PA3)

The points would be 1 * 8 + 0.92 * 7 + 0.9 * 6 + 0.8 * 5 + 0.7 * 4 = 26.64 points.

The total points (of 50 points) for PAs would be 43.44/50.

After your weighted average is calculated, letter grades will be assigned
based on the following grading scale:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr align="center" padding="10">
<td>A+</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>A-</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>D, F</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>&nbsp; >97&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 93-96.99 &nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 90-92.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 87-89.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 83-86.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 80-82.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 77-79.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 73-76.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 65-72.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; Below 64.99&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall class performance), but we guarantee that we will
not adjust the scale to make it harder to get a better grade.
In addition, you must pass the final exam in order to pass the course.

<b>Late and Makeup Work</b> In general, work cannot be handed in late for credit. We will drop the lowest weekly engagement score to account for personal events and constraints that make you miss those deadlines.

Programming work that is late follows the resubmission policy in <a href="#p:grading">the programming grades section</a>.

<b>Regrades</b> Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted, we will allow a short period for you to request a fix to your grade (announced along with the release of grades), with a clear argument for why a mistake was made. If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you were initially given is final. All regrades should be made through Gradescope's interface.

## <a id="policies" href="#policies">Other Policies</a>

<a id="p:community"></a>
<h3>The CSE 12 Community</h3>
CSE 12 is a large course: there are 9 people on the instructional team and over 100 students.  We are all here because we are excited about Computer Science and want to ensure a productive, interesting, and useful quarter.

At UC San Diego, we agree to hold ourselves to the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a> of respect, inclusion, and integrity.  This translates to all our interactions in this course, and beyond.

These practices go beyond the university setting. A huge amount of modern computer science happens via collaboration, in text, online. Sites like Stack Overflow and Github hold incredible wealths of information generated through asking and answering questions. Computer science research, large system development, and cutting-edge design happens through professional, high-volume mailing lists. Practicing using Piazza professionally prepares you for these situations, so do it mindfully.

Before you post a question or answer, consider:

- Does it contribute to a positive, constructive, and respectful forum for discussion and learning?
- <a id="p:piazza-ai"></a>Does it contain contain source code from your solution or other information that shouldn't be shared class-wide? Consider if the assignment is open or closed.
- Is it a question that's been asked before, that you could find via searching?

If you make a post that violates these guidelines, we may make it private and remind you of these guidelines. Overall, our goal is to make the public content on Piazza constructive and relevant for everyone.

## Student Resources and Support

### IDEA Engineering Student Center
The IDEA Engineering Student Center, located just off the lobby of Jacobs Hall, is a hub for student engagement, academic enrichment, personal/professional development, leadership, community involvement, and a respectful learning environment for all.  The Center offers a variety of programs, listed in the IDEA Center Facebook page at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea</a> (you are welcome to Like this page!) and the Center web site at <a href="http://idea.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://idea.ucsd.edu/</a>.  The IDEA Center programs support both undergraduate students and graduate students.


### Diversity and inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts,
perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is to create a diverse
and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide
diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way we can make you feel more included please
let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under
the door.  Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we
welcome your perspectives and input.


The Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) provides assistance to students, faculty, and staff
regarding reports of bias, harassment, and discrimination. OPHD is the UC San Diego Title IX office. Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions that are recipients of
federal funds. All students have the right to an educational environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.

Students have options for reporting incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment. Sexual violence includes sexual
assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Information about reporting options may be obtained at OPHD at
(858) 534-8298, ophd@ucsd.edu or <a href="http://ophd.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://ophd.ucsd.edu</a>. Students may receive confidential assistance at CARE at the Sexual
Assault Resource Center at (858) 534-5793, sarc@ucsd.edu or <a href="http://care.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://care.ucsd.edu</a> or Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at (858) 534-3755 or <a href="http://caps.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://caps.ucsd.edu</a>.

Students may feel more comfortable discussing their particular concern with a trusted employee. This may be a student affairs
staff member, a department Chair, a faculty member or other University official. These individuals have an obligation to
report incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment to OPHD. This does not necessarily mean that a formal complaint will
be filed.

### Students with Disabilities

We aim to create an environment in which all students can succeed in this course.  
If you have a disability, please contact the
<a href="https://disabilities.ucsd.edu/about/index.html" target="_blank">
Office for Students with Disability (OSD)</a>,
which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall, to discuss appropriate accommodations
right away.  We will work to provide you with the accommodations you need,
but you must first provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the OSD.  
You are required to present your AFA letters to Faculty (please make arrangements to contact me privately)
and to the OSD Liaison in the CSE department in advance so that accommodations may be arranged.
