## Getting the Code

The starter code is in the Github repository at  [https://github.com/ucsd-cse12-ss22/PA5_starter_code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse12-ss22/PA5_starter_code). If you are not familiar with Github, here are two easy ways to get your code.

1. Download as a ZIP folder 

   If you scroll to the top of Github repository, you should see a green button that says *Code*. Click on that button. Then click on *Download ZIP*. This should download all the files as a ZIP folder. You can then unzip/extract the zip bundle and move it to wherever you would like to work. The code that you will be changing is in the folder called *pa5-starter*.

2. Using git clone (requires terminal/command line)

   If you scroll to the top of the Github repository, you should see a green button that says *Code*. Click on that button. You should see something that says *Clone with HTTPS*. Copy the link that is in that section. In terminal/command line, navigate to whatever folder/directory you would like to work. Type the command `git clone _` where the `_` is replaced with the link you copied. This should clone the repository on your computer and you can then edit the files on whatever IDE you see fit.

If you are unsure or have questions about how to get the starter code, feel free to make a Piazza post or ask a tutor for help.
